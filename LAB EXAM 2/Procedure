Objective:
The objective of this lab is to design a network topology using RIP and OSPF protocols in Cisco Packet Tracer to enable communication between two LANs connected 
via a WAN link. Each LAN has uniquely assigned IP addresses incorporating the last three digits of the student’s roll number, ensuring customized configuration.

Network Design Procedure:

1. Device Placement
- Open Cisco Packet Tracer and place 10 computers in the workspace, separating them into two groups to represent two LANs.
   - Add a switch for each LAN, naming them as follows:
     - Switch_LAN1 for the first LAN.
     - Switch_LAN2 for the second LAN.
   - Add two routers:
     - Router_RIP to handle RIP protocol.
     - Router_OSPF to handle OSPF protocol.
   - Establish a connection between Router_RIP and Router_OSPF using a serial cable, creating a WAN link for inter-router communication.

2. Device Naming Convention
   - Name each computer in LAN 1 following the format `PC_001`, `PC_002`, etc., where the last three digits represent the last digits of the roll number.
   - Similarly, name each computer in LAN 2 as `PC_101`, `PC_102`, etc.

IP Address Configuration:

1. Subnet Design:
   - Assign LAN 1 to the subnet `192.168.1.0/24` and LAN 2 to the subnet `192.168.2.0/24`.

2. IP Assignment:
   - Each computer in LAN 1 should receive an IP address in the `192.168.1.x` range, with `x` being the last three digits of the roll number.
     - For example, if the roll number ends in 001, assign `192.168.1.001` to the first computer, `192.168.1.002` to the second, and so on.
   - Similarly, assign each computer in **LAN 2** an IP address in the `192.168.2.x` range, following the same rule.
   - Configure the LAN interfaces on each router with appropriate IP addresses for their respective LAN subnets:
     - Assign an IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.254`) for Router_RIP’s LAN interface.
     - Assign an IP address (e.g., `192.168.2.254`) for Router_OSPF’s LAN interface.
   - For the serial WAN connection, assign IP addresses to the serial interfaces of Router_RIP and Router_OSPF (e.g., `10.0.0.1` and `10.0.0.2` respectively).

Routing Protocol Configuration:

1. Configuring RIP on Router_RIP
   - Access Router_RIP and enable the RIP routing protocol.
   - Specify the subnet for LAN 1 (`192.168.1.0/24`) so it is recognized by RIP.
   - Include the WAN subnet (e.g., `10.0.0.0`) to allow communication across the WAN link.

2. Configuring OSPF on Router_OSPF
   - Access Router_OSPF and enable the OSPF routing protocol.
   - Specify the subnet for LAN 2 (`192.168.2.0/24`) so it is recognized by OSPF.
   - Add the WAN subnet (e.g., `10.0.0.0`) to facilitate communication across the WAN link.

Testing Procedure:

1. Verify Connections
   - Test connectivity within each LAN by sending ping requests between computers to ensure each device within the same LAN can communicate.
   - Check the connection between Router_RIP and Router_OSPF over the WAN link by verifying that the routers can successfully ping each other using their serial 
interface IPs.

2. Simulation Mode Testing
   - Enable Simulation Mode in Cisco Packet Tracer.
   - Select a computer in LAN 1 (e.g., `PC_001`) and send a test ping to a computer in LAN 2 (e.g., `PC_101`).
   - Observe the packet transmission path in simulation mode to ensure it travels through Router_RIP across the WAN link to Router_OSPF, ultimately reaching the 
target computer in LAN 2.

3. Result Verification
   - Confirm that the ping request and reply are successful, indicating complete connectivity between LANs.
   - Document any connectivity issues and the steps taken to resolve them.

Conclusion:

This configuration successfully establishes inter-LAN communication using RIP and OSPF routing protocols in a Cisco Packet Tracer simulation. With the routers 
configured to handle their respective LANs and the WAN link enabling routing between them, data transmission was verified across the networks. This lab exercise 
provided a practical understanding of setting up and testing routing protocols within a network topology.
